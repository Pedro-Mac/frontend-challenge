# Getting started

## Dependencies

In order to install all dependencies, you can run `yarn install`.

## Scripts

- Run `yarn start` to start development mode.
- Run `yarn build` in order to build the app for production.

## Challenges

- In this project I experimented building the application from wide screen to mobile. Now I understand why people really recommend mobile-first development, it's way easier to maintain and to debug. I think it was the first and last time I tried it.

- The file structure is a challenge for me, but I feel like I have been improving since my last projects. Sometimes I am not sure whether I should turn a view into more components, or when a component is getting too lengthy and perhaps I should turn it into more components.

- At some point, near the end of the project, I felt that I should have used Redux. At the beginning, I thought it would be overkill for a not so big app, but as I started creating more components, I started to have to pass properties deeper. If I would want to scale the app and I would have to pass props deeper, I would be in trouble.

## Wins

- I feel that I gave better usage to SCSS comparing to previous projects. Although it's a pretty small project, I got to use some of it's functionalities.

- Although I still have to improve many things on the usage of the `useEffect` hook, I am starting to feel way more comfortable in using it. Usually, at first, I get effects that I don't intend to have, but I was able to fix them quickly.

- It was the first time I've made the state persistent. I had never done it and to be honest, I thought it would be way more complex. It believe it can get more complex though, everything can.

- It was the first time that I considered the http request loading time. It is not so hard to implement and I should consider it from now on in my projects.
